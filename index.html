			<h1>Hello, I'm Amalia!! 🙃 </h1>

			<p>Hi, I'm a first year student at ESSEC business school. I'm passionate about traveling around the world, gymnastics and political debates. My dream job would be event project manager for the UN debates in Geneva</p>

			<h2>About travel 🌍</h2>
			<p>Travelling is a great passion, I find that it contributes enormously to open-mindedness. Growing up in an International School gave me the chance to get to know many different nationalities. I had the opportunity to do a language exchanges in the USA and in Spain. 
			Here is my travel history: 🇩🇰🇪🇦🇳🇴🇸🇪🇬🇧🇦🇺🇧🇪🇦🇷🇨🇦</p>

			<h2>About gymnastics 🤸</h2>
			<p>I have been practicing gymnastics since I was 4 years old. From the age of 10 I started to compete in teams and at 13 years old I started to compete individually. Unfortunately because of the coronavirus I had to stop doing gymnastics and today it's been 1 year and a half since I've been on a beam. I managed to find an alternative to ESSEC which is the association of cheerleading. </p>

			<h2>About Politics 📝</h2>
			<p>Before last year I wasn't interested in politics. It is with the MUN debate club of my high school that my interest developed. We debated topical issues and each person represented a country. Thanks to this club I was able to participate in a project of simulated parliamentary debate in Geneva. It was an incredible experience that made me want to work later in this environment. </p>
